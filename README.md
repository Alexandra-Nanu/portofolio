## Projects
### RNN-based Financial Time Series Prediction â€“ code NOT public yet
An empirical study using Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional RNNs) for predicting stock price movements based on historical market data. Built for academic research in financial forecasting, with performance evaluation through MAE and MSE, and analysis of model configurations for economic relevance.
### [Artificial Intelligence - Pacman Search](https://github.com/Alexandra-Nanu/AI--Project_2.git)
An Artifical Intelligence Project, using DFS, BFS, UCS and A* to help Pacman navigate mazes efficiently, optimizing path collection and path finding.
### [Artificial Intelligence - Pacman Complex Search]
An Artifical Intelligence Project, extending search techniques to multi-goal problems, implementing heuristics for corner-finding and food collection, while optimizing search efficiency.
